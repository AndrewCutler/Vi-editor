1
The heavens declare the glory of God;
    the skies proclaim the work of his hands.
2 
Day after day they pour forth speech;
    night after night they reveal knowledge.
3 
They have no speech, they use no words;
    no sound is heard from them.
4 
Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,
    their words to the ends of the world.
In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.
5 
    It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
    like a champion rejoicing to run his course.
6 
It rises at one end of the heavens
    and makes its circuit to the other;
    nothing is deprived of its warmth.
